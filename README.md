# Day Counter using JavaScript
This is a simple project that helps you count the number of days you've completed a task. You can increment the count, save the count to a list, and reset the count to zero.

## My Thought Process 👩‍💻
When I started working on this project, I wanted to create a day counter that would keep track of the number of times I've completed a task (Code challanges on Code Wars).

I began by creating a function to increment the count by 1 each time the user clicks on the increment button. Then, I created a function to save the count to a list when the user clicks on the save button.

Finally, I added a function to reset the count to zero when the user clicks on the reset button.

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot about JavaScript and creating dynamic web pages. As a junior front-end developer, I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- 
## How it Works
The project uses the DOM to update the text content of the count and list elements. The increment() function increments the count by 1 each time the user clicks on the increment button. The save() function saves the count to a list by concatenating the count with the existing text content of the list element. The nulls() function resets the count to zero and clears the list element.
